# Decorator Pattern

An example implementation of the decorator pattern in `C++`.

### Notes

- A decorator/wrapper implements the same interface that the object it is wrapping implements.
- Used to add additional behavior to classes at *runtime*.

### Plan

- [ ] Have a decorator for a side item to decorate the menu item interface
- [ ] Have a decorator for a condiment item to decorate the sandwich interface
